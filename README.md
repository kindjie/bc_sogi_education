# SOGI in BC Schools
For years I've seen the most outlandish conspiracies told about this innocuous initiative. I've gathered primary sources here to *hopefully* address the most common conspiracies and misinformation, without explicitly repeating them.

I urge anyone who finds a mistake in this post to comment with a correction.

---

## TLDR:
- SOGI is shorthand for "*Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity*" in general.
- SOGI policies for schools aren't new.
- **SOGI 123** is a specific education focused initiative.
- **SOGI 123** is *NOT* law.
- **SOGI 123** is *NOT* a class.
- **SOGI 123** is a resource for *local school districts* to implement their *own* SOGI policies.
- **SOGI 123** is help for schools and students to follow the **BC Human Rights Code** and the **Canadian Human Rights Act**.
- **SOGI 123** is found [here](https://www.sogieducation.org/resources/) with BC specific materials [here](https://www.sogieducation.org/our-work/where-we-support/british-columbia/).
- The BC Ministry of Education curriculum is [here](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/). There's no SOGI class.
- No one in education is asked to force (or even encourage) gender reassignment in children. It sounds unbelieveable because it is.

**How it came to be:**
1. BC passed Bill 27 amending the **Human Rights Code** to include "*gender identity or expression*".
2. Parliament of Canada passed Bill C-16 to amend the **Canadian Human Rights Act** similarly.
3. Human rights laws impact the Ministry of Education and Child Care’s [curriculum](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/).
4. The [ARC Foundation](https://www.arcfoundation.ca/) collaborated with the BC Ministry of Education, BC Teacher's Federation, and others to develop **SOGI 123** for schools as a resource for the above. Keep in mind, SOGI policies had *already been in schools for years* before this.
5. It had the goal of "*...[helping] educators make schools safer and more inclusive for students of all sexual orientations and gender identities through policies and procedures, guidance on creating inclusive environments and teaching resources*" according to their [website](https://www.sogieducation.org).

The BC government version of what I wrote above is [here](https://news.gov.bc.ca/factsheets/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-sogi-in-schools).

A completely different initiative is [erase](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/erase) (expect respect & a safe education). There's a bit of overlap between it and **SOGI 123**, so it's also worth a look.

**Why it matters:**
- In exchange for donations and an audience, politicians and commentators exploit conspiracies for personal gain.
- Real people get hurt - on both sides! People suffer serious consequences for buying into the BS, and innocent people are falsely targeted.
- Manipulating people with exagerated wedge issues and lies is wrong.

# SOGI at your school
For those researching the implementation of SOGI policies at your school (**SOGI 123** based or otherwise), you need to find the information on your **local school district**'s website.

If you're looking for a SOGI syllabus or coursework, it doesn't exist. You can find the actual BC school curriculum [here](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/).

Here's an example of a school district's SOGI policies:
1. [K̓wsaltktnéws ne Secwepemcúl’ecw School District No. 83](https://sd83.bc.ca/) has their policies listed on their website.
2. You can find "*Sexual Orientation Gender Identity (SOGI)*" under "*Safe and Healthy Schools*" in the top navigation menu.
3. There are several pages, one of which is a convenient [FAQ](https://sd83.bc.ca/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-sogi-inclusive-education-questions-answers/).

Your school district probably has something similar.

Some more examples from [here](https://bccpac.bc.ca/upload/2017/11/moe-sogi-policy-guide.pdf) (please excuse the dead links):
> **LANGLEY - Inclusive Anti-Harassment Policy** - *Langley School District* introduced an Anti-Harassment and AntiDiscrimination Policy in 2014 to define inappropriate behaviours and actions in order to prevent discrimination and harassment. The policy explicitly recognizes that students of sexual or gender minorities face a unique set of challenges within schools, which may have profound social consequences.

> **VANCOUVER - SOGI Policy** - *Vancouver School Board* implemented a stand-alone Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity policy in 2004 to address practices specific to sexual orientation and gender identity.

> **NANAIMO - Inclusion Policy** - *Nanaimo-Ladysmith School District* passed a new Inclusion Policy in June 2016 that replaces their current Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) and Multicultural and Race Relations (MCRR) policies. The policy is accompanied by enhanced SOGI administrative procedures.

As mentioned, the bills amended the [**Canadian Human Rights Act**](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/) and BC's [**Human Rights Code**](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/00_96210_01). It's probably easier to just reference them directly rather than going through the relevant bills. I'll go through the bills to give context to how **SOGI 123** came to be.

It's important to keep in mind that Canada has had these laws for decades. These were just relatively small amendments that were turned into easy wedge issues.

# Federal Bill C-16
Federal Bill C-16 guarantees rights that motivate the SOGI policies today. To verify any claims against ground truth, [here's the official wording of Bill C-16](https://www.parl.ca/documentviewer/en/42-1/bill/c-16/royal-assent) (see the PDF) that passed Royal Assent in 2017.

[This is the Legislative Summary published by parliament](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/LegislativeSummaries/421C16E). The relevant sections:
>## 2 Description and Analysis
>
> ### 2.1 Amendments to the _Canadian Human Rights Act_
>
> Bill C-16 adds references to “gender identity or expression” to two sections of the _Canadian Human Rights Act_.
>
> The first amendment is to the purpose of the Act, found in section 2, which currently reads:
>
>> The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.
>
> Clause 1 of Bill C-16 adds “gender identity or expression” to the list of grounds upon which discriminatory practices may be based.
>
> Section 3(1) of the _Canadian Human Rights Act_ enumerates the prohibited grounds of discrimination for the purposes of the Act (which are the same as those included in section 2 of the Act). Clause 2 of the Bill adds “gender identity or expression” to this section as an additional prohibited ground, after sexual orientation.
>
> ### 2.2 Amendments to the _Criminal Code_
>
> The bill also adds references to “gender identity or expression” to two sections of the _Criminal Code_, one dealing with hate propaganda and the other with sentencing provisions for crimes motivated by hate.
>
> As explained below, the amendments add “gender identity or expression” to the identifiable characteristics of a group that are protected from hate propaganda (see section 318(4) of the _Criminal Code_). The term “hatred” has been considered in several Supreme Court of Canada decisions, including _R. v. Keegstra_:
>
>> Hatred is predicated on destruction, and hatred against identifiable groups therefore thrives on insensitivity, bigotry and destruction of both the target group and of the values of our society. Hatred in this sense is a most extreme emotion that belies reason; an emotion that, if exercised against members of an identifiable group, implies that those individuals are to be despised, scorned, denied respect and made subject to ill-treatment on the basis of group affiliation.[43](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/LegislativeSummaries/421C16E#ftn43 "Note 43")
>
> #### 2.2.1 Hate Propaganda
>
> Criminal offences related to hate promotion are set out in sections 318 to 320.1 of the _Criminal Code_. Section 318 makes it an offence for anyone to advocate or promote genocide, which is defined as acts committed with an intent to destroy in whole or in part an identifiable group by either killing its members or inflicting on them such conditions as to deliberately bring about their physical destruction. Those found guilty may be punished by up to five years’ imprisonment.
>
> Section 319(1) makes it a criminal offence to incite hatred against any identifiable group where this is likely to result in a breach of the peace. Section 319(2) makes it an offence to communicate, except in private conversation, statements that wilfully promote hatred against an identifiable group, whether by telephone, broadcasting or other audible or visible means.
>
> Prosecutions of sections 318 and 319(2) require the consent of the provincial Attorney General.
>
> Section 319(3) includes various defences that are available for those charged under section 319(2):
>
> - that the communicated statements are true;
> - that an opinion or argument was expressed in good faith and either concerned a religious subject or was based on a belief in a religious text;
> - that the statements were relevant to a subject of public interest and were on reasonable grounds believed to be true; and
> - that the statements were meant to point out matters that produce feelings of hatred toward an identifiable group and were made in good faith for the purpose of removing those matters.
>
> Sections 320 and 320.1 of the _Criminal Code_ allow for judges to issue orders for the confiscation of any form of hate propaganda that if communicated would lead to an offence under section 319. The consent of the provincial Attorney General is again needed for these provisions to be used.
>
> The offences in these sections require that an identifiable group be targeted. Section 318(4) defines an “identifiable group” for all these provisions as being any section of the public distinguished by race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, or mental or physical disability. Clause 3 of Bill C-16 adds “gender identity or expression” to this section.
>
> #### 2.2.2 Sentencing Principles
>
> Clause 4 of the bill amends section 718.2 of the _Criminal Code_, which sets out certain principles to be taken into account during sentencing for an offence, including that “a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.” Currently, under subparagraph 718.2(a)(i), the following is deemed to be an aggravating circumstance: “evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor.” Clause 4 adds “gender identity or expression” to this list.

# BC Bill 27
Passed before the federal bill, [Bill 27 – 2016 Human Rights Code Amendment Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/bills/billsprevious/5th40th:gov27-3/) extends existing rights to *gender identities and expression*. This predicated **SOGI 123**, but the "*SO*" part of SOGI was already law with corresponding school policies.

> ## BILL 27 – 2016
>
> ### HUMAN RIGHTS CODE AMENDMENT ACT, 2016
>
> HER MAJESTY, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of British Columbia, enacts as follows:
>
> 1 Sections 7 (1) and 8 (1) of the Human Rights Code, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 210, are amended by adding ", gender identity or expression," after "sexual orientation".
>
> 2 Section 9 is amended by striking out "sexual orientation or sex" and substituting "sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression".
>
> 3 Section 10 (1) is amended by adding "gender identity or expression," after "sexual orientation,".
>
> 4 Sections 11, 13 (1) and 14 are amended by adding ", gender identity or expression," after "sexual orientation".
>
> 5 Section 41 (1) is amended by adding "sexual orientation, gender identity or expression," after "sex,".
>
> 6 Section 42 (1) (a) is amended by striking out "or sex," and substituting "sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression,".
>
> #### Commencement
>
> 7  This Act comes into force on the date of Royal Assent.

# BC Bill 50
[Bill 50, the _Human Rights Code Amendment Act_](https://www.leg.bc.ca/parliamentary-business/overview/41st-parliament/3rd-session/bills/1st_read/gov50-1.htm), reestablished the **British Columbia Human Rights Commission** to intervene in human rights complaints. There may be specific parts of local school policies related to this.

# SOGI 123
The [Arc Foundation](https://www.arcfoundation.ca/)  was established in 2007 and had done a lot of work by the time **SOGI 123** came out 10 years later. It got more attention after the aforementioned legislation became law.

The starting point for **SOGI 123** today consists of 10 basic practices compiled by the **BC Ministry of Education SOGI Working Group**. 

The [early guidance from \~2017](https://bccpac.bc.ca/upload/2017/11/moe-sogi-policy-guide.pdf) I referenced in my post from last year was:

> # Supporting Diverse Sexual Orientations, Gender Identities  and Expressions
>> “ With higher levels of discrimination and bullying, and lower level of family, school, and community support, LGBTQ youth face higher risks for significant health challenges, including suicidal thoughts and attempts, and problem substance use. However, when LGBTQ youth experience safe and supportive schools and families, they are much less likely to report these health challenges.\*” - Saewyc et al. (2016)
> 
> ## Goals for SOGI Inclusive Education:
> 1. Visibility: The diversity of sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions are recognized and valued.
> 2. Protection: The dignity of all people across the sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) spectra is intended to be preserved, as well as protected from harm.
> 3. Inclusion: Equitable treatment and inclusion are a reality for people of all sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions.
> 
> ## Best Practices:
> Policies and procedures that explicitly reference SOGI have been proven to reduce discrimination, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts for all students. The purpose of this document is to share best practices for creating more inclusive environments for all students. These best practices are informed by current research and jurisdictional scans as effective in promoting learning environments that are welcoming and inclusive for all members of the school community†.
> 1. **Common Language** (Definitions/Terms) - Every party involved will be well-informed and equipped with appropriate and respectful language. Any set of terms should acknowledge that language is ever evolving and that the individual is always the expert on how they may identify and on what language or terms they consider respectful and inclusive of themselves.
> 2. **Safety/Anti-Harassment** – Proactive and reactive measures that ensure students and staff are protected from bullying, discrimination, harassment and violence based on their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. For example, explicit Codes of Conduct.
> 3. **Self-Identification** – Students have the right to self-identification, which includes the name by which they wish to be addressed and their preferred pronouns that correspond to their gender identity.
> 4. **Confidentiality and Privacy** – Students have the right to confidentiality of their official and/or preferred sex, gender, and name. In class:  Staff will not expose sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression of students.
> 5. **Dress** – Students may express their gender identity or gender expression through what they wear to school. A dress code should be as all inclusive as possible, which may include removing pronouns.
> 6. **Gender Integrated and Inclusive Activities** – Schools will focus on integrated and inclusive activities. Where gender segregated activities continue to exist, students will have the option to be included in the group that corresponds to their gender identity or, in the case of gender non-conforming students, the group they would like to participate in.
> 7. **Educator Training** – Staff are supported with professional learning opportunities to develop a broader understanding of SOGI and the impact on students. Training should allow staff to appropriately deliver the curriculum, handle discrimination, and support individual needs.
>8. **Inclusive Learning** – Classroom materials and activities contain positive images and accurate information about sexual and/ or gender diversity, SOGI history and culture which reflects accomplishments and contributions of transgender and gender nonconforming people.
> 9. **Facilities** - Individuals may choose to use washrooms and change rooms that match their gender identity, including non-gendered single-stall washrooms and change rooms.
> 10. **Inclusive Extra-Curricular Activities** – Students will be included and accommodated for in all extra-curricular activities regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression, including support to set up a Gay-Straight Alliance.
> 
> \* Saewyc E., Poon C., Kovaleva K., Tourand J., & Smith A. (2016). School-based interventions to reduce health disparities among LGBTQ youth: Considering the evidence.
> † These best practices were co-developed by the Ministry of Education, ARC Foundation, Out in Schools, BCTF, University of British Columbia and K-12 educators

You will find these practices or similar ones listed in almost all implementations by BC schools, and it's very similar to what you can find today on [the official website](https://www.sogieducation.org/resource/10-key-components-for-policies-and-procedures/). The "Educator Training" and "curriculum" (as of January 2025) referring to small exercises and videos that teachers may choose to use as they see fit in *existing* courses.

[Here](https://www.sogieducation.org/resource/10-11-12-science-life-sciences-biology-anatomy-and-physiology-intersex-biology/) are suggestions for Science and Biology. For example, when covering hormones at grade 12:
> Hormones are responsible for the regulation of many body functions. Here we will take a closer look into how DNA, the blueprint for life, affects hormone production and, therefore, affects the expression and regulation of primary and secondary sexual characteristics in the human body.
> 
> Bio 12 / Anatomy and Physiology 12
> 
> Curriculum Entry Points:
> 
> Big Ideas:
> 1. DNA and Cells All living things are made of cells, which contain DNA and cell structures that allow cells to survive and reproduce.
> 2. Organization Organ systems have complex interrelationships to maintain homeostasis.
>
> Content:
> 1. organs within each of the systems are interconnected to maintain homeostasis:
>   - reproductive system
> 2. functional interrelationships exist among body systems
> 3. DNA carries the cell’s genetic information:
>   - process of DNA replication
>   - process of protein synthesis
>   - genomics
>
> ...

The full document is available [here](https://www.bctf.ca/classroom-resources/details/intersex-lesson). These are resources for established biology that has been taught for years. The material helps teachers cover sensitive topics that touch students with empathy and care; to promote understanding.

Again, a few important points:
1. **SOGI 123** is NOT legislation. The relevant legislation doesn't even mention it.
2. **SOGI 123** is a collection of general guidelines and resources.
3. Individual school districts *may* reference **SOGI 123** for their own implementations of sexual orientation & gender identity policies under the **[BC Human Rights Code](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/00_96210_01)** and the **[Canadian Human Rights Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/)**.
